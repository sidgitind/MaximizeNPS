📊 **NPS Corpus Growth Simulation with Top-Up & Optimal Allocation**

🚀 Overview

This application simulates the long-term growth of your National Pension System (NPS) corpus by applying different investment strategies over 30 years. The simulation uses a Monte Carlo approach to account for market variability and identify the optimal strategy.

This project has been completely built using genAI - ChatGPT. 

🎯 Project Goals

**Baseline Growth**: Simulate corpus growth with a fixed monthly contribution and no adjustments.

**Top-Up Strategy**: Apply additional investments when the market dips to buy more units at lower prices.

**Optimal Allocation Strategy**: Dynamically adjust equity and debt allocations to optimize returns based on market behavior.

**Combined Strategy**: Leverage both top-up and optimal allocation to maximize corpus growth.

**Monte Carlo Simulation**: Run multiple simulations to account for market fluctuations and assess variability in outcomes.

**📚 How It Works**

**Unit-Based Simulation:**

Corpus is converted into units with a starting NAV of ₹10.

Top-ups add units at the current NAV, increasing potential growth.

Optimal allocation dynamically changes equity and debt NAVs over time.

**Top-Up Trigger:**

Top-up occurs when the market drops by a predefined threshold (e.g., 10% dip).

Top-up buys additional units at a lower NAV, potentially boosting future growth.

**Optimal Allocation Logic:**

Equity and debt allocations are adjusted periodically to balance risk and returns.

The NAV of equity and debt grows independently based on simulated market conditions.

**⚙️ Initial Variables & Assumptions**

These assumptions serve as the foundation for the simulation:

**📊 Simulation Parameters**

Initial Corpus: ₹10,00,000

Monthly Contribution: ₹5,000

Tenure: 30 years (360 months)

Number of Simulations: 5,000 (can be adjusted)

Starting NAV: ₹10 per unit for all strategies

Equity Growth Rate: Avg 12% annual return (varies with market fluctuations)

Debt Growth Rate: Avg 7% annual return (varies with market fluctuations)

**💸 Top-Up Conditions**

Top-Up Trigger: Market dips by 10% or more.

Top-Up Amount: ₹10,000 per dip.

Cooling Period: 12 months (no subsequent top-up in this period after a dip).

Top-Up Unit Calculation:

Units Added
=
Top-Up Amount
NAV at Dip
Units Added= 
NAV at Dip
Top-Up Amount
​
 
**📊 Optimal Allocation Strategy**

Equity/ Debt Split: Dynamically adjusted based on market conditions.

Rebalancing Period: Annually (to restore optimal ratios).

Impact on NAV:

Equity NAV and Debt NAV grow separately.

Corpus rebalancing adjusts unit count in equity and debt accordingly.

**📏 Monte Carlo Simulation Parameters**

Randomized Growth Rates: Based on historical market volatility.

Equity Volatility: ±20% from mean.

Debt Volatility: ±5% from mean.

**📊 Capabilities**

✅ Simulates long-term growth for NPS corpus using different strategies.

✅ Tracks NAV, Units, and Corpus Growth across 30 years.

✅ Identifies the impact of top-ups and allocation changes using historical market trends.

✅ Provides percentile-based insights to understand best-case, worst-case, and average outcomes.

✅ Allows configuration of market dip thresholds, allocation ratios, and simulation parameters.

**📈 Output & Interpretation**

**🎯 Simulation Summary**

✅ Simulated 5000 runs successfully!

📈 Average Corpus Results after 30 years:

📈 Baseline: ₹5.20 Cr ± ₹4.16 Cr

💸 Top-Up: ₹5.22 Cr ± ₹4.16 Cr

📊 Optimal Allocation: ₹4.31 Cr ± ₹3.12 Cr

🏆 Combined Strategy: ₹4.31 Cr ± ₹3.12 Cr


**📊 What Does This Mean?**

Baseline: Outcome if only monthly contributions are made without intervention.

Top-Up: Additional corpus from investing more during market dips.

Optimal Allocation: Results from dynamically adjusting equity and debt.

Combined Strategy: Impact of combining both strategies.

**📏 Deviation Explanation**

The deviation (± Cr) represents the potential variability in outcomes.

Higher deviation indicates more uncertainty, while lower deviation suggests more predictable outcomes.

More simulations reduce deviation and stabilize predictions.

**📊 Percentile Insights**

**📢 Percentile Interpretation**

90th Percentile: The best-case scenario where the corpus performs better than 90% of the simulations.

50th Percentile: The median case where the corpus performs better than 50% of the simulations—considered the most likely outcome.

10th Percentile: The worst-case scenario where the corpus performs better than only 10% of the simulations, indicating a downside risk.

📊 Percentiles give a range of possible outcomes, helping you to understand both the upside potential and downside risks in the strategy.

**📢 Next Steps**

Fine-tuning: Experiment with different top-up thresholds and allocation rules.

Optimizing Simulations: Increase simulation count for better accuracy.

Performance Enhancements: Use parallel processing for faster results.
