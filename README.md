📊 NPS Corpus Growth Simulation with Top-Up & Optimal Allocation
🚀 Overview
This application simulates the long-term growth of your National Pension System (NPS) corpus by applying different investment strategies over 30 years. The simulation uses a Monte Carlo approach to account for market variability and identify the optimal strategy.

🎯 Project Goals
Baseline Growth: Simulate corpus growth with a fixed monthly contribution and no adjustments.

Top-Up Strategy: Apply additional investments when the market dips to buy more units at lower prices.

Optimal Allocation Strategy: Dynamically adjust equity and debt allocations to optimize returns based on market behavior.

Combined Strategy: Leverage both top-up and optimal allocation to maximize corpus growth.

Monte Carlo Simulation: Run multiple simulations to account for market fluctuations and assess variability in outcomes.

📚 How It Works
Unit-Based Simulation:

Corpus is converted into units with a starting NAV of ₹10.

Top-ups add units at the current NAV, increasing potential growth.

Optimal allocation dynamically changes equity and debt NAVs over time.

Top-Up Trigger:

Top-up occurs when the market drops by a predefined threshold (e.g., 10% dip).

Top-up buys additional units at a lower NAV, potentially boosting future growth.

Optimal Allocation Logic:

Equity and debt allocations are adjusted periodically to balance risk and returns.

The NAV of equity and debt grows independently based on simulated market conditions.

📊 Capabilities
✅ Simulates long-term growth for NPS corpus using different strategies.
✅ Tracks NAV, Units, and Corpus Growth across 30 years.
✅ Identifies impact of top-ups and allocation changes using historical market trends.
✅ Provides percentile-based insights to understand best-case, worst-case, and average outcomes.
✅ Allows configuration of market dip thresholds, allocation ratios, and simulation parameters.

📈 Average Corpus Results after 30 years:
📈 Baseline: ₹5.20 Cr ± ₹4.16 Cr
💸 Top-Up: ₹5.22 Cr ± ₹4.16 Cr
📊 Optimal Allocation: ₹4.31 Cr ± ₹3.12 Cr
🏆 Combined Strategy: ₹4.31 Cr ± ₹3.12 Cr
📊 What Does This Mean?
Baseline: Outcome if only monthly contributions are made without intervention.

Top-Up: Additional corpus from investing more during market dips.

Optimal Allocation: Results from dynamically adjusting equity and debt.

Combined Strategy: Impact of combining both strategies.

📏 Deviation Explanation
The deviation (± Cr) represents the potential variability in outcomes.

Higher deviation indicates more uncertainty, while lower deviation suggests more predictable outcomes.

More simulations reduce deviation and stabilize predictions.
